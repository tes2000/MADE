## Title

Crime Data Analysis in Los Angeles

## Main Question

1. What are the patterns in crime types and locations across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles?
2. How do crime rates vary by time of day, day of the week, or season in Los Angeles?
3. Can we predict future crime hotspots based on historical data?

## Description

The objective of this project is to analyze and model crime data in Los Angeles to identify spatial and temporal patterns. By examining historical crime incidents, we aim to uncover insights into when and where various types of crimes are most likely to occur. Leveraging a dataset that includes information on crime type, location, and date, this project will employ data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict potential crime hotspots.
The analysis will provide a deeper understanding of crime patterns in Los Angeles, potentially aiding in proactive law enforcement and community awareness. This project will involve data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model development, and visualization to provide actionable insights.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Kaggle Crime in Los Angeles Dataset
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/fadymamdouh01/crime-in-los-angeles-data/input
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains records of crime incidents in Los Angeles, with details on crime type, location, date, time, etc. It offers a comprehensive view of crime in the city, allowing for spatial and temporal analysis. Key attributes in the dataset include:

- **Date Rptd**: Date the crime was reported
- **AREA NAME**: Specific neighborhood and approximate location of the incident
- **Crm Cd Desc**: Classification of the crime (e.g., assault, theft)
- **DATE OCC**: Date when the crime occurred, useful for time-based pattern analysis
- **TIME OCC**: Time when the crime occured.
- etc

## Work Packages

1. Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. Conduct basic statistics, visualizations, and summary reports on the dataset to understand its characteristics.
3. Identify key factors (e.g., location, time) that influence crime rates.
4. Explore various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to detect high-crime areas.
5. Analyze crime patterns based on time of day, day of the week, and season.
6. Develop predictive models to forecast crime hotspots based on historical data.
7. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision for hotspot predictions.
8. Visualize spatial crime patterns using geospatial mapping techniques.
9. Document the methodology, findings, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
10. Build a dashboard for interactive visualization of crime data (optional).
